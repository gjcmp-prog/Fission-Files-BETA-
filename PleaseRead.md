# Fission Files (BETA)

---<strong>Concept</strong>---

This project is the BETA of a larger database that is currently in development. The <em>Fission</em> story is inspired by the Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 storylines.
The Application is an I/O console application for the Windows OS that uses strings, integers and a series of "if" and "else" statements to simulate a terminal computer in a post-nuclear war America set in the 1950s.</br></br>

***<em>All Characters in the database are fictional and all stories are purely works of my imagination.</em></br></br></br>
